Cowbell (formerly MLKit)
======

JavaScript web application framework.

A previous version is in use at [SignNow](https://signnow.com) (under the previous name of MLKit)

Acknowledgement
------------

Cowbell is heavily inspired by Apple's [UIKit](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIKit_Framework/_index.html) and [SproutCore](http://sproutcore.com/) (which was also inspired by UIKit)
Additionally, some concepts, code or inspiration has been borrowed from [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/). Both awesome frameworks in their own right.
