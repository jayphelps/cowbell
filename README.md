MLKit
======

JavaScript web application framework.

Status
---------------

Not usable at this point. Only a fraction of the code has been cleaned up and commited.

These classes still need to be cleaned up:
  - Event
  - Screen
  - RootResponder
  - Router
  - Model
  - ControlView
  - ButtonView
  - TemplateView
  - etc

ML.View is also missing a majority of it's helper methods.

A previous version is in use at [SignNow](https://signnow.com)
